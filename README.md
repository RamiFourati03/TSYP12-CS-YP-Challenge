> An intelligent security operations platform combining BERT-based threat detection with automated response orchestration

## 🌟 Overview

This project implements a comprehensive security operations platform that leverages advanced AI/ML capabilities to enhance traditional security tools. By combining BERT-based models with multi-RAG agent systems and XAI, we create an intelligent security layer that can detect, analyze, and respond to threats in real-time.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Our solution consists of three main components:

### 1. AI Base Layer
- BERT-based threat detection model
- Multi-RAG AI agent for intelligent analysis
- Machine learning pipeline for continuous improvement

### 2. Network Security Layer
- Integration with pfSense for network monitoring
- XAI for enhanced Suricata capabilities
- Advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF) for application security
- LimaCharlie EDR for endpoint detection and response
- Real-time traffic analysis and filtering

### 3. Automation & Response Layer
- Tines playbook execution
- Automated incident response
- Integration with security tools (Alien Vault, SOCRadar)
- IoC database management

## 🔧 Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| BERT Model | Threat pattern recognition and analysis for web server |
| Multi-RAG Agent | Intelligent decision making and correlation |
| pfSense + SURICATA | Network monitoring and intrusion detection enhanced by XAI |
| WAF | Web application protection and traffic filtering |
| LimaCharlie | Cloud-native EDR and security operations |
| Grafana | Security metrics visualization and alerting |
| Tines | Security automation and orchestration |

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Collection**: Log sources → pfSense/SURICATA/LimaCharlie
2. **Web Security**: Traffic filtering through WAF
3. **Analysis**: Network data → BERT/Multi-RAG processing
4. **Intelligence**: AI analysis → IoC database
5. **Response**: Automated actions via Tines playbooks
6. **Monitoring**: Real-time visualization in Grafana
